It would be beneficial to invite more people, beyond just the judging panel, to view and evaluate the students' projects. Since our products are designed to help everyday heroes, those same heroes should be part of the feedback process. This would provide valuable insights from different perspectives on whether the products are truly helpful to them and increase the chances of broader adoption.3.In my regional competition, the judges were divided into four groups, each assigned to different rows to evaluate and provide feedback. This can sometimes lead to unfair outcomes. For instance, if one group of judges doesn't find a project interesting, it might miss the chance to get positive feedback from another group. Rotating judges between different groups would promote fairness and allow for more comprehensive evaluations from diverse viewpoints.Aside from these points, I believe everything else about the competition was well-organized. I hope my feedback is helpful, and thank you again for this incredible opportunity.""}, {'id': 'QnF9YlQvA', 'question': '7. Over the last few months, you have become better in ..
